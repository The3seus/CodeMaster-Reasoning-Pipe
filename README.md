## 🚀 Overview

`CodeMaster Reasoning Pipe` is an experimental reasoning framework designed to extend the capabilities of modern LLM chat UIs by integrating structured, iterative thinking directly into the pipeline. Inspired by cognitive architectures and multi-model orchestration, it introduces a "reasoning pipe" model that can:

- Perform **initial reasoning breakdowns**
- Iteratively refine solutions via **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**
- Generate precise, context-aware **final responses**

This project is especially useful for:
- Enhancing explainability in AI systems  
- Testing multi-model reasoning with OpenAI or Ollama  
- Debugging complex prompts and logic chains  
- Building AI agents with a transparent reasoning trace

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🛠 **Model Routing**: Dynamically switch between OpenAI and Ollama for both reasoning and response stages.
- 🔁 **Chain-of-Thought Iterations**: Tunable multi-pass reasoning to refine logical plans.
- 💬 **Reasoning Trace**: Optional traceable reasoning output for debugging and transparency.
- ⏱ **Timeout Handling**: Max reasoning time to prevent runaway processes.
- 🧪 **Plug-and-Play**: Designed for integration with Open WebUI and modular LLM backends.

## 🧠 Design Principles

- Modular reasoning `Valves` define which models to use and how.
- FastAPI-compatible for async performance and scalable inference.
- Designed to work with WebUI/Ollama ecosystem out of the box.

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### Plug into your Open WebUI fork or FastAPI app:

```python
pipe = Pipe()
await pipe.pipe(
    body=request_body,
    __user__=user_data,
    __event_emitter__=event_stream_callback,
    __request__=fastapi_request
)
```

### Customize Models in `Valves`:

```python
pipe.valves.REASONING_MODEL = "llama3:13b"
pipe.valves.RESPONDING_MODEL = "gpt-4"
pipe.valves.COT_ITERATIONS = 3
pipe.valves.ENABLE_SHOW_REASONING_TRACE = True
```

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt Flow

1. **Initial Reasoning**  
   Breaks down the user query into key components and strategies.

2. **Chain-of-Thought**  
   Iteratively refines the approach across multiple passes.

3. **Final Response**  
   Consolidates reasoning into a clean, executable or actionable answer.
